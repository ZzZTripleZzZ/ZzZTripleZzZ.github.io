## Digital Network Twins
### Advanced Technologies Section (ATS) Seminar Series @ ORNL

Digital Network Twins (DNTs) are virtual representations of physical networks and offer promising solutions for managing complex network environments, especially when combined with machine learning methods like federated learning (FL) and reinforcement learning (RL). In this talk, we will discuss how DNTs address pressing challenges in advanced networks such as 6G. FL allows for decentralized model training, which improves data privacy and reduces communication demands by enabling devices to train locally. RL supports autonomous decision-making, helping networks respond to changes in traffic and system demands in real time. This approach addresses important goals like reliable data forecasting, efficient resource use, and enhanced security. We will also introduce practical applications, including edge caching and secure vehicle networks, highlighting how these methods shape adaptive network systems with stronger automation, reliability, and security.

## Short Bibliography


I'm currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/), working with Professor [Yuchen Liu](https://nicelab.us/). I obtained my BS and MS degree both from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/), supervised by Professor [Jia (Kevin) Liu](https://kevinliu-osu.github.io/). I am broadly interested in building trustworthy and intelligent wireless netowrk and communications with advanced techniques, including federated learning, digital twins, reinforcement learning, etc.

## Research Interests

My research pursuits are rooted in the confluence of wireless networks, machine learning, and mobile computing, each bearing the potential to profoundly impact modern technological landscapes. In the sphere of networking and systems, I delve into exploring wireless technologies, envisioning new network architectures, developing protocols, investigating digital twins, and fortifying security measures. Transitioning into machine learning, my focus broadens to harnessing generative AI, fostering self-awareness systems, and employing data analytics to enhance networking, sensing, and security paradigms. The realm of mobile computing beckons with opportunities in infrastructure mobility, employing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and orchestrating robotic networked systems.
